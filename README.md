This is a relativly simple that allows you to switch between 3 different punishments for shooting an innocent (as an innocent):
1. Default - You drop your gun and cannot pick it back up. You can still pick up guns other players drop.
2. Prevent Gun Pickup - You drop your gun and cannot pick up any guns for the rest of the round.
3. Kill Shooter - You die along with the player you shot.

# Commands
`/setShootInnocentPunishment [default/preventGunPickup/killShooter]` - Requires OP.
